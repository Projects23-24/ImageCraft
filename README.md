# Image Processing on FPGA Using Convolution Operations

In this Verilog project, some simple Image processing operations are implemented such as Blur, Gaussian blur, Brightness control and Inversion operations. We undertook the task of standardizing RGB images to a resolution of 400x300 pixels. We directly stored the whole image file in Block RAM. Subsequently, we performed convolution operations on FPGA to apply various effects to the images. These operations were executed on an FPGA board, and the processed images were displayed on a monitor using the VGA standard, ensuring compatibility and seamless visualization.
